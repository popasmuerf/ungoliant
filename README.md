## Branches and HEAD


- A branch is just a link between different commits
or a pathway through the commits.
- An important thing to note is that while working with branches, the HEAD of a branch points
- to the latest commit in the branch.
- In Git, the HEAD points to th elatest commit in a branch.
- In Git the HEAD refers to the tip of a branch
- In Git a branch is essentially a pointer to a commit, whihc has a parent commit,
a grandparent commit, a great-grandparent commit, and so on.
- HEAD and the timp of a current branch point to th esame commit.
